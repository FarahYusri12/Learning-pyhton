# Learning-pyhton
This repository was created as learning materials for analyzing the data by using pyhton language.

**File : Jualan.ipynb**

This file focused more on the analysing the data such as calculate the total sale **(Jumlah)** based on state **(Negeri)** and month **(Bulan)**. Furthermore, basic function such as **df.info()**, **pd.to.datetime** and **df.groupby()** also has been applied.



And many more, but Im tired to write it all. 
Thank you.
