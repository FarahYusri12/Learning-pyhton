# Learning-pyhton
This repository was created as learning materials for analyzing the data by using pyhton language.

Learn several basic function such as
* df.info()= get info about the data
* pd.to.datetime(df[])= to change the datatype for date from **object** to **datetime64**
* df.groupby()

And many more, but Im tired to write it all. 
Thank you.
